## âœ… How It Works
The lamp is connected to a basic server that listens for the toggle command from the web interface. When the toggle switch in the UI is flipped, a JavaScript function sends a command to the server, which then turns the lamp on or off accordingly.
This repository contains the code for a smart lamp that I designed. The lamp can be controlled through a web interface to toggle its power state (on/off) using JavaScript. This project demonstrates the application of basic JavaScript toggling functionality to control hardware devices.
